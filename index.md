## Estimating Optimal Hedge Ratio

An investor wishes to hedge a long position in the S&P500 using a short position in futures contracts. The investor is interested in the optimal hedge ratio, i.e., the number of units of the futures asset to sell per unit of the spot assets held.

To analyse the hedge ratio, we run a bivariate regression using STATA. We use the monthly data on S&P500 Index and S&P500 Futures for period September-1997 to March-2018.
